## Sorry, we shut down
After a lot of internal debate and soul searching, we have made the decision to shut down BUGSKAN, retasking the breakthrough technology we developed, along with the amazing team behind it.

The decision was not an easy one. We invested a lot of time, money and emotional capital in this fun and progressive experiment. We still believe BUGSKAN is amazing, but it never found the group of devoted customers it needed to survive.

We’d like to thank everyone who supported BUGSKAN and provided valuable feedback. You all played a critical role in this journey.

We hope you’ll join us for the next chapter, as we continue our efforts to make the web safer.

For questions or help with issues related to the shut down, please contact us at bugskan2015@gmail.com

Cheers!

The BUGSKAN Team
